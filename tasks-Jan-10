Things to do for the next couple of weeks:


Establish the following:

* Gene-Gene (GG) network in Dicty
* Gene-Citation-Gene (GCG) network in Dicty

Collect data on functional similarity, in all 3 GO aspects. 
Functional similarity will be measured using precision / recall as in CAFA. (Iddo will provide code).

1. Are we seeing a better functional similarity in one GO aspect over the others?

Remove high-throughput papers from the dataset, check again.
